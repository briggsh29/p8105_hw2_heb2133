## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
             range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls), 
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    ) 
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018:

``` r
precipitation_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)
             
precipitation_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1
    ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation:

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
      month = 1:12,
      month_name = month.name
    )

precipitation_df = 
  bind_rows(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)  
  
precip_final_df = left_join(precipitation_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information about the Mr. Trash Wheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. Key variables in this dataset includes
year, month, weight of trash collected, and specific kinds of trash.
There are a total of 14 columns in this dataset and 344 rows.

The precipitation dataset contains information on inches of
precipitation measured each month. In our consolidated dataset of
precipitation in 2017 and 2018, key variables include year, month (by
numeric order and name), and inches of precipitation. There are a total
of 4 columns and 24 rows.

``` r
precip_sum_2018 = 
  precipitation_2018 %>% 
  select(total) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, sum)
```

The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.3 inches.

``` r
trashwheel_2017 = 
  filter(trashwheel_df, year == 2017) %>% 
  select(sports_balls) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, median)
```

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the NYC transit data. Convert the entry variable from
character to a logical variable.

``` r
NYC_transit_df = 
    read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data (1).csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, 
      names_to = "route_number",
      names_prefix = "route",
      values_to = "route_name") %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, YES = TRUE, NO = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset containes information on each subway entrance and exit
station in New York City. Key variables include subway line, station
name, latitude and longitude of the subway station, entrance type (e.g.,
stairs, door), if ADA compliant, if entrance is allowed, if vending, and
the number and name of routes served. There are 20548 rows and 10
columns in this dataset.

To clean this dataset I cleaned up the dataset names and converted
“entry” into a logical (true/false) variable. Originally, there were
11 route number variables contianing route names as values - to tidy
this data I used combined route name and route number into two separate
corresponding variables.

There are 465 distinct stations in this dataset, and 5148 stations are
ADA compliant. There are 2013 station entrances/exits without vending,
and 759 of them allow entrance. So 0.3770492 of station entrances/exits
without vending allow for entrance.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables:

``` r
NYC_distinct_df =
    distinct(NYC_transit_df, station_name, line, route_number, route_name, ada) %>% 
  filter(route_name == "A")
```

60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of these stations, 17 are ADA
compliant.

## Problem 3

Read and clean pols-month.csv dataset (refer to comments for further
details on cleaning steps)

``` r
politicians_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv.") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
                        "01" = "january", 
                        "02" = "february",

                        "12" = "december"
                        )) %>% 
  arrange(month) %>% 
  #Separated out "mon" variable; and
  #Replaced "month" ouput with month names
  mutate(prez_gop = ifelse(prez_gop == 0, "no", "rep")) %>%
  mutate(prez_dem = ifelse(prez_dem == 0, "no", "dem")) %>%
  unite(president, c(prez_gop, prez_dem)) %>% 
  mutate(president = recode(president, "no_dem" = "dem", "rep_no" = "rep")) %>% 
  #Used prez_gop and prez_dem to create new president variable
  subset(select = -c(day))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
  #Removed day variable
```

Read and clean the snp.csv dataset.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv.") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year"), "/") %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) %>% 
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
                        "1" = "january", 
                        "2" = "february",
                        "3" = "march",
                        "4" = "april",
                        "5" = "may",
                        "6" = "june",
                        "7" = "july",
                        "8" = "august",
                        "9" = "september",
                        "10" = "october",
                        "11" = "november",
                        "12" = "december"
                        )) %>% 
  arrange(month) %>% 
  #Separated out "date" variable to multiple columns; and
  #Replaced month output with month names
  subset(select = -c(day)) %>% 
  #Removed day variable
  relocate(year, month)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Read and clean the unemployment dataset:

``` r
unemploy_df = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv.") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec, 
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) %>% 
  #Tidied month and unemployment variables; and
  #Modified month variable in code below
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
                        "jan" = "january", 
                        "feb" = "february",
                        "mar" = "march",
                        "apr" = "april",
                        "jun" = "june",
                        "jul" = "july",

                        "dec" = "december"
                        ))

    ## )

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and then merging
unemployment into the result.

``` r
pols_snp_df = 
  left_join(politicians_df, snp_df, by = c("year", "month"))

pols_snp_unem = 
  left_join(pols_snp_df, unemploy_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```
